        Low-level attacks can be effective, but are riskier than high-level attacks. We will learn the 3 most common low-level attacks: The single leg, the high crotch, and the double leg.
        Always keep your head up when taking a shot. Always perform a level change. A shot without a level change is guaranteed to fail! Understand the difference between a high-crotch (head on the outside) and a single leg (head on the inside) and which side to shoot to (determined by your lead leg).</a></td>
